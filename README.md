# Crypto-Hustle-Pro

Crypto Hustle Pro is an app that displays information about cryptocurrencies, which was accessed using API calls. It also includes a search bar that allows users to search for a specific currency. It is part of a lab from Codepath's Web course.

### Features
Part 1:
 - [x] Create an API key
 - [x] Read API documentation to understand how to make requests, either in GitHub docs or using the examples on the organization’s website
 - [x] Use the useEffect() hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions
 - [x] Fetch API data with async/await syntax
 - [x] Use props to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases
 - [x] Use conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not
 - [x] Additionally practice using CSS to format pages

Part 2:
- [x] Clicking on a currency in the list displays more information about it, such as its description, algorithm type, and price history
- [x] Each currency has a direct, unique link to each its own page
- [x] The site displays a graph of a currency’s change in price over time

## Project Demo

### Install Dependencies

Before installing dependiencies, you will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine by installing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) onto your machine.

To install the dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Run Crypto Hustle Lite

Note: In the 'required features only' version of this lab, there is no side navigation bar with the list of crypto scams, however the current state of this repo includes the stretch features, where that side nav bar has been included.

In the repo directory, run the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Visit the web application in the browser

```console
http://localhost:5173/
```
## Notes

In the lab, I gained knowledge and skills in several areas related to web development. Firstly, I learned how to read and understand API documentation, which is essential for making requests using APIs. I also learned how to use the useEffect() hook to mount and unmount components in a more efficient way compared to the previous methods. Additionally, I practiced creating components and sending props, which is a useful technique for sharing data between components.

I also learned how to fetch API data using async/await syntax, which allows for better handling of asynchronous operations. Conditional rendering was another concept that I learned during the lab, where I used if statements or ternary operators to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not. Finally, I also practiced using CSS to format pages and enhance their visual appeal.

During the 2nd portion of this project, I learned how to use React Router to configure routes and create nested routes, handle "no match" cases, and add params to routes. I am also able to utilize the Link component to navigate to other views, making each clickable and providing a detailed view of the selected item. This knowledge allows me to create a dynamic and user-friendly web application.

Overall, the lab provided me with valuable experience in several essential areas of web development, including API usage, asynchronous programming, component creation, and CSS formatting
