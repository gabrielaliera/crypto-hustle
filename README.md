# Crypto-hustle

Crypto Hustle is an app that displays information about cryptocurrencies, which was accessed using API calls. It also includes a search bar that allows users to search for a specific currency. It is part of a lab from Codepath's Web course.

### Features

 - [x] Create an API key
 - [x] Read API documentation to understand how to make requests, either in GitHub docs or using the examples on the organizationâ€™s website
 - [x] Use the useEffect() hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions
 - [x] Fetch API data with async/await syntax
 - [x] Use props to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases
 - [x] Use conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not
 - [x] Additionally practice using CSS to format pages

## Project Demo

Here's a demo that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Setup

### Dependencies

* [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite)
* [Vite React Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react)

### Install Dependencies

Before installing dependiencies, you will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine by installing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) onto your machine.

To install the dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Run Crypto Hustle Lite

Note: In the 'required features only' version of this lab, there is no side navigation bar with the list of crypto scams, however the current state of this repo includes the stretch features, where that side nav bar has been included.

In the repo directory, run the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Visit the web application in the browser

```console
http://localhost:5173/
```
## Notes

In the lab, I gained knowledge and skills in several areas related to web development. Firstly, I learned how to read and understand API documentation, which is essential for making requests using APIs. I also learned how to use the useEffect() hook to mount and unmount components in a more efficient way compared to the previous methods. Additionally, I practiced creating components and sending props, which is a useful technique for sharing data between components.

I also learned how to fetch API data using async/await syntax, which allows for better handling of asynchronous operations. Conditional rendering was another concept that I learned during the lab, where I used if statements or ternary operators to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not. Finally, I also practiced using CSS to format pages and enhance their visual appeal.

Overall, the lab provided me with valuable experience in several essential areas of web development, including API usage, asynchronous programming, component creation, and CSS formatting
